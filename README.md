# Considerate_Driver
HCIN 720 Project 2: measuring acceleration and record location

##Introduction
The project is composed of two parts:
###1. Input
The device is used to encourage drivers to be considerate when there are other passengers on the car. When the driver drives aggressively, the device will show red. 
Services like Uber or public transit can use the data to evaluate the performance of their drivers.
The device records road conditions and locate bumps and dips on the road.
###2. Output
It is a simple navigation tool. The device reads the address of a destination input by the user and shows red if the car is driving further away form the destination and shows green if closer.
